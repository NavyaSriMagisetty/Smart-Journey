# Smart-Journey
* Traffic in a city is very much affected by traffic light controllers. 
* When waiting for a traffic light, the driver looses time and the car uses fuel.
* Hence, reducing waiting times before traffic lights can save billions of rupees. 
* Smart Journey will make the road users receive information about how to drive through a city in order to minimize their waiting times.
* Our idea of this project is to reduce the long term waiting time of the vehicles.

# Working of the project
* Suppose a car starts its journey from the source it communicates with the traffic lights which are to be crossed in order to reach the destination.
* By measuring the time taken from source to the traffic light and the to show green or red signal it indicates the speed to travel.
* By this we can save a lot of time and we can save our life without going in over speed.
