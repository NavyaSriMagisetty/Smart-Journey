Traffic in a city is very much affected by traffic light controllers. When waiting for a traffic light, the driver looses time and the car uses fuel. Hence, reducing waiting times before traffic lights can save billions of rupees. Intelligent traffic light control does not only mean that traffic lights are set in order to minimize waiting times of road users, but also that road users receive information about how to drive through a city in order to minimize their waiting times.  Our idea of this project is to reduce the long term waiting time of the vehicles. Suppose a car starts its journey from the source it communicates with the traffic lights which are to be crossed in order to reach the destination. By measuring the time taken from source to the traffic light and the to show green or red signal it indicates the speed to travel. By this we can save a lot of time and we can save our life without going in over speed.
